## Used technologies:
- **Typescript**:  a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces. One of the big benefits is to enable IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code;
- **React**: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces;
- **React-router**: client side routing;
- **Redux**: a predictable state container for JavaScript applications;
- **Redux Toolkit**: toolset for efficient Redux development;
- **SASS**: css preprocessor;
- **Ant Design**: a React UI library;
- **@ant-design/plots**: a React chart library (for statistic);
- **ESLint** (*eslint-airbnb-config*), **Prettier** and **Editorconfig**: lint and format code
