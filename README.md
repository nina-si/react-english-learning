# English Learning App

A graduation project for [RS School](https://rs.school/). A web application for learning English created by the team of 3 developers. I designed and implemented from scratch Main Page and Textbook Page.

## What is it for?

You can learn and repeat words on the Textbook Page or play minigames for memorizing words. Authorized users can also track their progress.
